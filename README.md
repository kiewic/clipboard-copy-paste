# Windows Clipboard Copy & Paste Using C#

Gets all the content from the Windows Clipboard, and creates a new IDataObject with only
the selected formats, and puts them back into the clipboard.
All other formats are removed from the clipboard.

This is a good C# example of:

* How to check what is inside the clipboard.
* Retrieve content from the clipboard.
* Add multiple formats at the same time into the clipboard.
